The SeedStack W20 bridge acts as an integration bridge between the Seed Java framework and the W20 Web framework. You can
add it with the following dependency:

{{< dependency g="org.seedstack.addons.w20" a="w20-bridge-web" >}}
    
The W20 masterpage (generally `index.html`) is generated by the add-on and don't have to be provided by the developer.
You can still provide your own masterpage by disabling the automatic one. Use the following configuration to do so:

    org.seedstack.w20.disable-masterpage = true

The W20 configuration (generally `w20.app.json`) is read from `META-INF/configuration` classpath directory and automatically
managed. Some values are automatically added by the add-on and don't need to be explicitly specified:

* `w20-core`
  * `application`
    * `id`: set to the application identifier defined in Seed configuration. Cannot be overridden.
  * `environment`
    * `type`: set to the Seed configuration property `org.seedstack.w20.environment`.

For each fragment the following variables are defined:

* `seed-base-path`: the path to the application document root.
* `seed-rest-path`: the path to the application rest base path.
* `seed-webresources-path`: the path to the application static resources servlet base path.

The add-on provides a SPI to allow other add-ons to further override configuration.
